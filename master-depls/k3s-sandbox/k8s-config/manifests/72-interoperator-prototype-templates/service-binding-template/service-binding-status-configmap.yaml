# This is a research spike for service authors to return a config map with expected status to interoperator
# instead of authoring gotemplate status
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: service-binding-status-${binding_id}
  annotations:
    service_instance_id: ${instance_id}
data:
  # the service binding status returned if the Kustomization is status is successfull
#  state: "failed"
#  state: "in progress"
  state: "succeeded"

  # This can support authors performing input validation or returning status of a job
#  error: "failed to provision service binding: invalid parameter x requested"
  # Typical response include
  # - access url templated from ${instance_id}
  # - login/password looked up from a secret produced by a 3rd party author (e.g. PerconaXtraDb cluster)

  # Alternative ways to produce this resulting ConfigMap/secret (brainstorming)
  # - A Job/CronJob with k8S api credential, polling for objects & writing the resource
  #    - Indirectly by writing to a file in a volume (simpler for authors), and a side car reflects it as a secret
  # - A Job/CronJob with git push credential, writing a file used by Flux Kustomize Config Generator
  # - A kyverno policy watching expected Secret and mutating this ConfigMap
  #     - A Policy can look up external data, including a configmap https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/external-data-sources/
  #     - A Policy can look up any K8S resource with a K8S api call, https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/external-data-sources/#variables-from-kubernetes-api-server-calls
  # - A naming convention in the returned response, and the interoperator go template performs the secret lookup and injects it
  #   -
  # - Modifying the 3rd party artefact to also create this expected secret
  #   - helm post-renderer
  #   - kyverno policy
