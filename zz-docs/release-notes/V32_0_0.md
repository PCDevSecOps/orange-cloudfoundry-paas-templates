# V 32.0.0

## feature-refactoring-cloud-config

### Feature content
Refactoring of bosh directors cloud-config **micro** and **master**.

- [x] Refactor template/cloud-config-tpl.yml
- [x] Update vars and operators files in ***template/openstack-hws*** and ***template/openstack***
- [x] Delete `cli_version: v1` in ops-routing deployment
- [x] Fix terraform bootstrap (resources deletion between micro-depls and nat-gateway terraform operations)
- [x] Fix bootstrap commands result

### To do (ops)
- Delete following values in ***shared/secrets.yml***

```
secrets:
  openstack:
    networks:
      net-bosh-2:
        range: 192.168.116.0/24
        gateway: 192.168.116.1
        reserved: 192.168.116.1 - 192.168.116.20  #--- Exclude gateway and dhcp address
        static: 192.168.116.21 - 192.168.116.200  #--- Static ips
```

## feature-secure-grafana-coab
This branch aims to secure the access to grafana coab with uaa.
The client UAA declaration was included in the branch feature-cf-deployment-v287.

Status
* [x] Authentication complete

Authorization doesn't work (not yet supported => This is not possible actually. Grafana is working on external auth backends (see grafana/grafana#11354 <https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/11354> ), this will allow to create a custom UAA plugin that can be used to map roles/orgs.) 
This feature will go live after the branch feature-prometheus-for-coab and feature-cfdeployment-*.

**How to test**
Successful connection to https://grafana-coab.${ops-domain}/ with your CF user

## feature-fix-sandbox
Some pre-requisites are missing in order to deploy elpaaso-sandbox ui and services as cf apps.
This branch aims to setup them in paas-template distribution.
* [x] cf create-user  sandbox-admin  <password> => done in ops-depls/cf-apps-deployments/elpaaso-sandbox/pre-cf-push.sh
* [x] cf set-org-role  sandbox-admin  orange-private-sandboxes OrgManager => done in ops-depls/cf-apps-deployments/elpaaso-sandbox/pre-cf-push.sh
* [x] cf create-space default-space dans org sandbox => done in ops-depls/cf-apps-deployments/elpaaso-sandbox/pre-cf-push.sh

## feature-intranet-interco-relay-single-instance

### Feature content
Adapt **intranet-interco-relay** deployment with single instance (pending HA solution like loadbalancing openstack), and delete **docker-bosh-cli-service** deployment.

***Intranet Interco Relay single instance***
- [x] Delete vrrp vars/operators in **intranet-interco-relay** and ***master-depls/template/openstack-hws***
- [x] Move Ips to static bloc in cloud-config
- [x] Update **intranet-interco-relay** manifest (include static ips)

***Docker Bosh Cli Service deletion***
- [x] Delete **gin-efa-relay-service*#* and **docker-bosh-cli-service** deployments
- [x] Delete **intranet_interco_ips.srv** entry in ***shared/secrets.yml***
- [x] Delete reference to **intranet_interco_ips_srv** in credhub-seeder and cloud-config

### To do (ops)
#### Docker Bosh Cli Services deletion **(CW and FE platforms)**
- Delete **gin-efa-relay-service** and **docker-bosh-cli-service** directories in secrets repository
```bash
$ cd <root secret repo dir>
$ rm -fr master-depls/docker-bosh-cli-service
$ rm -fr master-depls/gin-efa-relay-service
```

- Log onto docker-bosh-cli and delete deployments on master-depls (log-bosh and select **master** bosh director)
```bash
$ bosh -d docker-bosh-cli-service delete-deployment
$ bosh -d gin-efa-relay-service delete-deployment
```

#### Intranet Interco Relay single instance **(only on Flexible Engine platform)**
##### Prerequisite
- Pause job **master-depls-generated** / **deploy-intranet-interco-relay** in Concourse Web UI, before applying new tag from **develop** branch

##### Impacts
Unavailability on ops, api and apps access is estimated to 5 mns

##### Manual steps:
- Rename ***intranet_gateway*** to ***gateway*** in ***shared/secrets.yml***

```
secrets:
  intranet_interco_ips:
    intranet_gateway: xxx
```

to

```
secrets:
  intranet_interco_ips:
    gateway: xxx
```

- Align interco subnet ips values in secrets repository (***shared/secrets.yml*** and ***micro-depls/terraform-config/secrets/meta.yml***)
  - **api** with **cf-api**
  - **apps** with **cf-apps** and **cf-apps-http**
  - **ops** with **cf-ops**
  - **to_intranet** with **intranet-http-proxy**, **elpaaso-fpv-intranet**, **elpaaso-mail** and **elpaaso-mail-1**

>
**Note:** Configured IPs must match currently used in master-depls deployment if present (execute bosh instances to keep used Ips)

```bash
Instance                                          Process State  AZ  IPs
api-relay/e94a29c5-f852-427a-9aa7-ecb5ace3a45b    running        z1  xxx
apps-relay/840f4632-ede1-4506-a915-986ae3b2ae59   running        z1  xxx
ops-relay/21afa1d9-92f1-4346-a1a6-6f952fe525bc    running        z1  xxx
to-intranet/d2e658f3-7290-4029-8942-88652a47fb60  running        z1  xxx
```

- Check if credhub-seeder has changed Interco Ips
```bash
$ credhub g -n /secrets/intranet_interco_ips_api
$ credhub g -n /secrets/intranet_interco_ips_apps
$ credhub g -n /secrets/intranet_interco_ips_ops
$ credhub g -n /secrets/intranet_interco_ips_to_intranet
```

- Check if cloud-config update has been applied on **intranet-ha-interco** network (log-bosh on **master** director)
```bash
$ bosh cloud-config
```

```bash
networks:
- name: intranet-ha-interco
  subnets:
  - az: z1
    cloud_properties:
      net_id: ((/secrets/intranet_interco_ips_net_id))
      security_groups:
      - tf-default-sg
      - tf-intranet-http-sg
      - tf-intranet-https-sg
    dns:
    - 192.168.116.155
    - 192.168.116.165
    gateway: ((/secrets/intranet_interco_ips_gateway))
    range: ((/secrets/intranet_interco_ips_range))
    reserved:
    - ((/secrets/intranet_interco_ips_gateway))
    static:
    - ((/secrets/intranet_interco_ips_api))
    - ((/secrets/intranet_interco_ips_apps))
    - ((/secrets/intranet_interco_ips_ops))
    - ((/secrets/intranet_interco_ips_to_intranet))
```

- Trigger **master-depls-generated** / **Terraform** for vrrp port deletion

- Delete (if present) ***ops-depls/cloudfoundry/terraform-config/spec/security-groups.tf*** in secrets repository

- Trigger **ops-depls-generated** / **Terraform** for CF security group creation

- Trigger **ops-depls-cf-apps-generated** / **Utils** / **retrigger-all-jobs**

- Restart all CF customers applications (script to execute from docker-bosh-cli)
```bash
$ cd <root template repo dir>
$ cd master-depls/scripts
$ log-cf
$ restart-cf-apps.sh
```

- Unpause **master-depls-generated** / **deploy-intranet-interco-relay**
   - Check prometheus alert manager to verify if api, apps, ops and to_intranet access are operative

## feature-remove-prometheus-v1
Prometheus v1 is no longer used, since v2 introduced. bi-mode should be otber, so we delete its v1 instance

## feature-logsearch-bosh-v2
Transform Logsearch's manifests to BOSH v2

:warning: BOSH has to recreate instances from scratch. All Elasticsearch data and thus all logs will be lost!

### Changes

Logsearch and Logsearch Ops will be upgraded to v207 & v209.

A dedicated Cerebro instance will be available for Logsearch

Login credentials:<br>
The user is `cerebro` and the password is in credhub. After credhub login, get it with:
`bosh int <(credhub get -n /bosh-master/logsearch/cerebro_auth_password --output-json) --path=/value | cat`

### Preflight checks

Verify in Cerebro Ops that Logsearch Ops's Elasticsearch cluster is green

### Steps

- Push `paas-template` code after merge
- Configure logsearch in `bosh-cloudwatt-secrets/master-depls/logsearch/secrets/meta.yml`

```yaml
---
meta:
  logsearch:
    elasticsearch_master_instances_count: 3
    elasticsearch_data_instances_count: 5
    ingestor_instances_count: 4
    elasticsearch_data_instances_vm_type: large
    elasticsearch_master_instances_vm_type: large
    ingestor_instances_vm_type: large
  elasticsearch_data:
    health:
      timeout: 1800
```

Set content of `bosh-cloudwatt-secrets/master-depls/logsearch/secrets/secrets.yml` to the minimum:

```yaml
---
secrets:
```

Then commit these two files.

- Delete current logsearch deployment on `bosh-master`<br>
```console
$ bosh -d logsearch delete-deployment --force
```

- Push `bosh-cloudwatt-secrets`

- Trigger the `master-depls/logsearch` in Concourse if necessary<br>
:warning: Smoke tests may fail if logs can't be found in Elasticsearch within 60s. Depending on the load of the ingestors and indexers, logs processing can take more than 60s and make the smoke tests fail.

:warning: If Logsearch Ops's elasticsearch job fails on first deployment attempt, retrigger corresponding job in Concourse.
## feature-fix-etherpad
Fix Etherpad deployment on Flexible Engine

## feature-bootsrap-fix
Fix items encountered during the installation of the FE production platform, and add improvements controls for potential cases:
**Fix:**
- [x] Add **unzip** tool installation on bootstrap VM (needed on bootstrap.sh for unzipping some packages)
- [x] Add createDirForFile() function in several scripts to create (if not present) directory in secrets repository before using it
- [x] Replace "~" by "/home/cloud" in *init-password.sh*
- [x] Replace "cp ${TERRAFORM_CONFIG_SECRETS}/spec-${IAAS_TYPE}/sg-internet.tf" with "cp ${TERRAFORM_CONFIG}/spec-${IAAS_TYPE}/sg-internet.tf" (old constraint in paas-template for security group needed for concourse web UI access with floating IP)

**Improvements:**
- [x] Verify presence of Corporate certs before using it
- [x] Verify presence of concourse credentials files before using it

## Fix fast persistent disks properties
Some disk types are meant to be fast, but do not necessarily contain the necessary properties for the IaaS to provision them on fast performing infra.
This adds missing properties.

## Feature ldap auditor group
Add auditor ldap group for contributors who needs bosh and credhub access without admin rights
- [x] Add group creation in **init-schema.ldif**
- [x] Update **create-admin.sh** and **delete-admin.sh** to select group type (admin / auditor)

## feature-branche-hotfix-prometheus-cf-minio
* fix: no protocol for exporter reference to minio

## feature-hotfix-metron-for-inet-is
* adds metron add-on for internet is. Should enable internet is cf logs, and global metrics.
* fixes lack of variability for diego cells isolation segments (number of diego cells can't be changed in paas-secrets)
* fixes wrong vm-type for diego cell (default, must be xxlarge)

See more background on the metron agent role in the log pipeline: ![Loggregator schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-release/develop/docs/loggregator.png) at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-release/develop/docs/loggregator.png

## feature-hotfix-internet-isolation-segment
raise limitation on master-depls/cf gorouter, sharding all

- application in internet isolation segment must be reachable from
intranet gorouter.
- sharding mode for internet go router keeps share-segment

Manual step:
-  to ensure proper defaut isolation segment for new spaces, use :

```
cf set-org-default-isolation-segment org1 my_segment
```
- for existing projects, must manually set the isolation segment on each space.
- Apps must be restarted (cf restart) to the placement to the correct isolation to occur.
