# V 37.0.0
## Release overview:
- cf-deployment 2.7
- new cf autoscaler service
- new dedicated vm in demand mysql service (coab)
- new dedicated vm in demand mongodb service (coab)
- long term metrics for prometheus
- stemcell bump 3586.67

## Version installation
This is a major version, each feature will trigger multiple updates / vm recreation if applied sequentially.

The following update procedure is recommended:
- upload manually the stemcell on each director
- pause key deployments (for individual upgrade ): gitlab/credhub/openldap
- pause bosh root deployment pipelines (micro/master/ops/coab/kubo/ ops-depls-cf-apps)
- push new paas-templates version
- create shield buckets backups with master-depls/shield/scripts/init-shield.sh
- prepare prerequisite (s3 bucket for metrics)
- update your secrets following indication below (shared/secrets.yml and per deployment secrets.yml)
- launch micro-depls/credhub-seeder
- launch micro-depls/concourse-credhub seeder
- on concourse, launch COA job execute_deploy_script on all root deployments (micro/master/ops)
- on concourse, apply individually cloud-config and runtime config per root deployment.
- unpause sequentially each director (micro, master, ops)
- on concourse, apply terraform per root deployment.
- coab
- cfcr

## know limitations
- coab backup naming conflict. https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/252
- bosh dns misconfiguration
- bad node-exporter version (1.0.0, must be 4.1.0 in ops-depls/template/deploy.sh)

## feature-prometheus-long-term-storage
Major prometheus update:
- add credhub metrics collection and alerts
- long term (unlimited) storage of metrics, thanks to a s3 backend, thanos prometheus add-on
- ha multi-az prometheus and grafana deployments
- bump to prometheus bosh release 23.4.0
- bump to node_exporter 4.1.0
- coab metrics federation
- Add Prometheus rules to monitor apps in system domain.
- fix blackbox http scraping. Blackbox exporter was on ops-relay, security groups prevent prometheus => prometheus exporter 9115 traffic to relays (due to openstack-hws urbanism, no private ip on default sg). We had to find another reachable hosting/location for blackbox exporter, probes are now hosted as cf apps (one in intranet cf org, the other in internet org)

- [x] federate coab-depls metrics

- [x] add alerting for cf apps in system_domain cf org

#### Limitations (know remaining issue)
- https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/241 (blackbox http proxy support is KO)

### Ops user new features
- Metrics visible from grafana portal are not anymore limited to 30 days. Older metrics are now sent to s3 and transparently accessible from grafana.
- new grafana portal version 2.5.6
- new metrics collected from credhub, and related alerts for expired certificates

### Manual platform ops steps
- ensure master-depls/cloud-and-runtime config is successfull (bosh-dns alias add on must be updated)
- create a standard bucket in an external s3 provider (eg: Flexible engine Object Store), with standard SLA, private access, named prometheus-thanos-bucket-<site> (usually, the s3 providers require unique bucket name).
- also you can remove all previous secrets master-depls/prometheus/secrets/ directory (including meta.yml and secrets.yml)
- set the bucket secrets in master-depls/prometheus/secrets/secrets.yml

```
secrets:
...
  thanos_s3_bucket: <redacted_prometheus-thanos-bucket> 
  thanos_s3_endpoint: <redacted_S3_endpoint>
  thanos_s3_insecure: "false"
  thanos_s3_signature: "true"
  thanos_s3_access_key: <redacted_access_key>
  thanos_s3_secret_key: <redacted_secret_key>
```

- for new node_exporter 4.1.0 to apply, must ensure the deploy.sh, then runtime-config is applied, then operators should retrigger all bosh deployments.

- ensure only critical cf-apps are deployed in system_domain cf orgs (alerts now triggered for all system_domain failing cf apps)
- in secrets repo, rename ops-depls/cf-apps-deployment/probes to probe-intranet, set the enable-cf-app.yml file

```

    cf_organization: orange-internet
    cf_space: prometheus-probe
```

- Remove legacy system_domain/prometheus-probe space

### Expected availability impacts
- ops portal: down 5min

## feature-fix-cached-bp-fs3
bump cached ci pipeline, support linuxfs3. We also add a retrigger job to republish all buildpacks and better display (tabs split by alphabetically ordered).

### References
- fix https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/173
- fix https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/73
- fix https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/218

### Content (implementation)
- bump concourse pipeline from https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/ci-buildpack-cached

### Manual platform ops steps
- Please add concourse secrets to `master-depls/cached-buildpack-pipeline/secrets/secrets.yml`:
```
secrets:
 ...
  concourse:
    password: <redacted_password> #atc concourse account password
```

- in concourse/master-depls/master-depls-cached-buildpack-pipeline, launch the **detect-previous-versions** job (this should load minio-s3 with required versions)
- in concourse/master-depls, apply terraform (this should load buildpacks in cf)

## feature-stemcell-3586.67
bump stemcell 3586.67

### References
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-linux-stemcell-builder/releases/tag/stable-3586.67

### Content (implementation)
- bump stemcell on micro/master/ops/coab/kubo depls

#### Limitations (know remaining issue)
- https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/101 : on Flexible Engine, we still observe glance image leaks. Operators might need to purge manually the image catalog. related symptom:

```
Task 999612 | 17:17:37 | Update stemcell: Extracting stemcell archive (00:00:03)
Task 999612 | 17:17:40 | Update stemcell: Verifying stemcell manifest (00:00:00)
Task 999612 | 17:17:41 | Update stemcell: Checking if this stemcell already exists (00:00:00)
Task 999612 | 17:17:41 | Update stemcell: Uploading stemcell bosh-openstack-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent/3586.67 to the cloud (00:00:06)
                      L Error: CPI error 'Bosh::Clouds::CloudError' with message 'OpenStack API Bad Request. Check task debug log for details.' in 'create_stemcell' CPI method
Task 999612 | 17:17:47 | Error: CPI error 'Bosh::Clouds::CloudError' with message 'OpenStack API Bad Request. Check task debug log for details.' in 'create_stemcell' CPI method
```
To avoid the glance image duplication, a manual bosh upload stemcell per director is required:

```
bosh upload-stemcell --sha1 49b16e4dd0ca43f6b0c8f31553610e68b1eac3c1 \
  https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-openstack-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent?v=3586.67 --fix
```

Nb:
- If glance quota is reached, delete the previous images with openstack cli / portal.
- the --fix flag forces the bosh director update of a stemcell, even if already existing.

### Manual platform ops steps
- a staged deployment is recommanded (micro, master, ops, kubo, coab sequence)
