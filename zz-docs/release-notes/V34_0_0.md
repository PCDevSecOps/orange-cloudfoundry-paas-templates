# V 34.0.0
## releases overwiew:
- multiple fixes wrt to bootstrap / secrets management.
- stemcell and bosh director update
- for Flexible Engine, switch to kvm flavors
- initial CloudFoundry Container Runtime / Kubo inclusion for platform use (not visible from plateform end users)

## feature-fix-cf-isolation-credhub-config
fixes secrets mapping errors introduced when migrating from ops-depls/cloudfoundry (cf-release) to master-depls/cf (cf-deployment).

context:
- cf-release used the /cf/xx credhub namespace for generated credhub variables
- cf-deployment now uses deployment level credhub namespace (/bosh-master/cf/xx). It should not reference legacy /cf/ secrets, except for databases passwords in master-depls/cloudfoundry-datastore.

NB: pre v30 platform had no visible issue, as they were using pre v30 populated secrets in credhub. New post v30 platform  see this issue while bootstrapping.

Fixes:
- [x] fix api key and certs location (now master-depls/cf instead of ops-depls/cloudfoundry)
- [x] provision coa-cf scim uaa account in cf-deployment
- [x] fix master-depls/logsearch-ops reference to cf uaa admin secret
- [x] fix missing /cf/cc_bulk_api_password
- [x] fix /cf/cc_db_encryption_key.

Manual step for pre v30 platforms:
- deploy master-depls/cf. If its an existing deployment, you must feed the previous ccdb encryption key, then redeploy master-depls/cf.
```
credhub set -n /bosh-master/cf/cc_db_encryption_key -t password
password: redacted_password #<previous ccdb password>
```
- in secrets repo, move ops-depls/cloudfoundry/secrets/api-certificates directory to master-depls/cf/

## feature-update-stratosv2-in-portals
- [x] Update Stratos Console v2 links in ops and users portals.
- [x] Add prometheus/Grafana links in CFCR section in ops-portal.

Depends on !170

## feature-bosh-266.x
reference:
- https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/releases/tag/v265.4.0
- https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/releases/tag/v265.1.0
- extends lifecyle support on bosh release (eg: post-stop)

content:
- [X] bump uaa release to 60.2 (secures micro-depls/credhub-ha and all bosh directors)
- [x] bump bosh-deployment v1.1.0. https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment/releases/tag/v1.1.0
- [x] update micro-depls/bosh-master
- [x] update master-depls/bosh-master
- [x] update master-depls/bosh-ops
- [x] update master-depls/bosh-coab
- [x] update master-depls/bosh-kubo
- [x] activate uaa login on bosh master / ops / coab /kubo
- [x] use client-id on all prometheus-exporter (so access token are refreshed) see https://github.com/bosh-prometheus/bosh_exporter#flags

manual steps:
- this feature enables uaa sso on bosh-ops/bosh-coab/bosh-kubo. Be sure to logout and re login with you ldap credentials

```
bosh logout
bosh login
```

- update the bosh-ops, bosh-coab admin password  in secrets repo, master-depls/concourse-ops/pipelines/credentials-ops-depls-pipeline.yml

```
...
bosh-target: 192.168.99.152
bosh-username: redacted_username # use 'admin' for now
bosh-password: redacted_password #from credhub get -n /bosh-master/bosh-ops/admin_password
```
- update secrets for micro-depls/credhub-ha (uaa 60 requires new encryption key secret)

```
secrets:
  uaa_encryption_key_1:  CeptyaytmybnopOcauBiOjcicOpsya #generate with tool like eg: apg -m 30

```

- trigger https://elpaaso-concourse-micro.<ops-domain>/teams/main/pipelines/bootstrap-all-init-pipelines
- trigger https://elpaaso-concourse-micro.<ops-domain>/teams/main/pipelines/ops-depls-init-generated/jobs/update-pipeline-ops-depls
- trigger https://elpaaso-concourse-micro.<ops-domain>/teams/main/pipelines/ops-depls-generated/jobs/update-pipeline-ops-depls-generated
- NB: manual trigger due to https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/cf-ops-automation/issues/183
- if necessary, bosh repair the child deployments (might lock due to nats ssl introduction on director side with state "unresponsive agent ")

```
bosh -d <deployment> cck
=> choose "3: Recreate VM without waiting for processes to start"
```
- final clean in secrets: ops can safely delete secrets.yml and meta.yml files in secrets repo for bosh-master/ bosh-ops / bosh-coab / bosh-kubo / bosh-expe deployments (operators credentials are now uaa/ldap)

## Update docker-bosh-cli to 2.1.22

**Note:** This update has to be done only for Flexible engine platform

### To do (ops)

- Update docker-bosh-cli release for all users in **micro-depls/docker-bosh-cli/secrets/secrets.yml** file from secrets repository

```yaml
  - name: &user2_bosh_cli xxx
    hostname: *user2_bosh_cli
    image: orangecloudfoundry/orange-cf-bosh-cli:2.1.22
```

- Save and push file update to secrets git repository

## feature-bump-3586-27
update stemcell for:
- [x] on ops-depls
- [x] master-depls
- [x] micro-depls
- [x] coab-depls
- [x] kubo-depls

see https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-linux-stemcell-builder/releases/tag/stable-3586.27

prerequisites:
- switch to flexible engine kvm flavors (ie: s3.xxx)
- fix bosh compilation network dns

## feature-switch-openstack-hws-to-kvm-vm_type
change all openstack-hws vm type to s3.xx flavors (kvm).
Caution: this will recreate all vms. Use a stage deployment (one root deployment at a time), and pause critical component for separate update (ie: micro-depls/gitlab, micro-depls/concourse-micro, master-depls/openldap)

## feature-bosh-kubo
adds components to support Cloudfoundry Container Runtime - CFCR aka kubo
- a new bosh director bosh-kubo (as k8s is incompatible with bosh assigned human readeable instances names)
- a private dns alias bosh-kubo.internal.paas
- a new cf ops automation COA root deployment, to support bosh and terraform deployments
- a dedicated network for kubo deployments.
- a new cfcr bosh deployment (migrated from expe-depls/cfcr deployment), based on cfcr 0.20
- a new harbor bosh deployment
- an internal alias for cfcr kubernetes api, access is https://cfcr-api.internal.paas

This provides a shared k8S cluster, cfcr 0.20, k8S 1.11.1

Prequisite:
- k8s terraform plugin support in COA
- for openstack, add the tenant-id on shared/secrets.yml, and launch micro-deps/credhub-seeder.

Manual steps:
- generate the master-depls/bosh-kubo director and uaa ssl certs. You should get this secrets files in master-depls/kubo-depls:

```
[bosh-kubo]# tree secrets
secrets
├── certificates
│   ├── certs
│   │   ├── director.crt
│   │   ├── director.key
│   │   ├── rootCA.key
│   │   ├── rootCA.pem
│   │   ├── rootCA.srl
│   │   ├── uaa-sp.crt
│   │   ├── uaa-sp.key
│   │   ├── uaa-web.crt
│   │   └── uaa-web.key
│   ├── generateCerts.sh
│   ├── generate-uaa-ssl-certs
│   └── uaa-certs
│       ├── server-ca.crt
│       ├── server-ca.key
│       ├── server.crt
│       ├── server.csr
│       └── server.key
├── meta.yml
└── secrets.yml

```
- activate master-depls/bosh-kubo deployment (in secrets, enable-deployment.yml, meta and secrets file)
- configure the kubo-depls concourse pipelines in secrets, activating terraform support, in micro-depls/concourse-micro/pipelines/credentials-auto-init.yml

```
concourse-kubo-depls: fe-int-micro-for-kubo-depls
concourse-kubo-depls-target: https://192.168.116.151
concourse-kubo-depls-username: redacted_username # hardcoded to 'atc' for now
concourse-kubo-depls-password: redacted_password
concourse-kubo-depls-insecure: "true"
```

- trigger master-depls/bosh-kubo deployment
- trigger kubo-depls/cloud-and-runtime-config
- trigger kubo-depls/terraform to create the kubo network (you will have terraform k8s errors, as the cfcr is not yet deployed. check that terraform creates the iaas network) and storageclass for kubernetes
- trigger the kubo-depls/cfcr (ensure the bosh errand has run successfully)
- retrigger kubo-depls/terraform. this time, it will be able to configure k8s elements in kubo-depls/cfcr
- trigger the kubo-depls/cfcr-addons (ensure the  bosh errand has run successfully) to set default storageclass and install helm chart describe into differents cfcr-addon operators.

- connect to the kubernetes dashboard https://ingress-ops.<ops-domain>/dashboard/, with the token from credhub
```
credhub get -n /bosh-kubo/cfcr/kubo-admin-password
```
