# V 36.0.0
## Release overview:
- support multiple intranets isolation segment.
- remove ocb specific supervision interco

## feature-isolation-segment-intranet-2
This features introduces a seperate isolation segment for a separate intranet interco. This pattern could be generalized
NB: openstack-hws only.

- one master-depls/cf deployment
- one internet org and isolation segment
- n intranet orgs and isolation segment, with configurable intercos, ca, dns ...

Thus, we use the intranet-2 naming as we expect to soon introduce an isolation segment for intranet.
- [X] define private network. For intranet-2, we use 192.168.29.0/24
- [X] define secrets location + certs location + credhub seeding
- [X] terraform automation for network
- [X] terraform automation for cloudfoundry org, domain (not shared) and isolation segment
- [X] define cloud-config for intranet-2-interco network
- [X] configure intranet 2 interco vm
- [x] add static routing from interco VPC to Paas VPC for inbound traffic
- [x] define required cf security groups
- [X] intranet 2 dns, managed by a dedicated bosh-dns server on to-intranet vm
- [X] add a squid proxy server to enable http/https intranet_2 access from cf apps.
- [x] add an alias for intranet-2 proxy (new terraform powerdns config in master-depls/terraform-config)

Manual steps:
- create FE VPC for intranet-2 VPC interco
- define static routing from interco VPC to Paas VPC (for 192.168.29.x/24, tcp)
- define peer routing from Paas VPC to interco VPC subnet
- define intranet_2 specific properties in shared/secrets.yml

```
 #--- Intranet 2 interco network
  intranet_interco_2:
    range: xx.xx.xx.xx/28
    gateway: xx.xx.xx.xx
    domain: yyy.com
    cf_org: my_intranet_org2
    to_intranet: xx.xx.xx.xx
    apps: xx.xx.xx.xx
    intranet_dns: xx.xx.xx.xx

```
- define the gorouter and cells pool sizes in master-depls/isolation-segment-intranet-2/secrets/meta.yml
- set Wildcard intranet-2 domain cert and key in /shared/certs/intranet-2-certs/server.crt and server.key
- launch micro-depls/credhub-seeder job
- once isolation segment is deployed, launch terraform/ops. This will create the org, isolation-segment, application security group, and cf domain
- Important: Manually define intranet-2-isolation segment as default is the the org. (no automation for this in current cloudfoundry terraform plugin)

```
cf set-org-default-isolation-segment <intranet-2 org> intranet_2_isolation_segment
```
- also set ASG security group for all intranet 2 cf org, eg:

```
cf bind-security-group sec_group_intranet_2 <intranet-2 org> --lifecycle running

```

## feature-stratos-bump-v2
* Bump stratos to the latest 2.x stable release version (instead of a locked version. Risks of regressions with Stratos releases seems limited and can be overriden by a feature branch by ops team).
* Refined diagnostics when pushing the app (display git version details).
* Enabled the display of the git version details in the about->diagnostics page within stratos
* Disabled Orange branding, see https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/orange-component-CF-UI2/issues/1

## feature-faq-howtos
adds FAQ / HOWTOS markdown files for ops and architects

## feature-extract-ocb-admin-interco
This feature is related to each runners and should be deploy as a feature branch in each environment.
- No more OCB related networks
- No more OCB related notifications

---

:warning: `OCB runners: Be sure the feature branch exists in your git repository before applying this update`

## feature-mysql-mplabels
* Nouveau noms /description des plans avec MariaDB (et suppression de pivotal).
* Fichier 6-context-patch-operators.yml découpé en 3 pour séparer les domaines de modifications
  -	20-rename-deployment-operators.yml
  -	30-broker-patch-operators.yml
  -	31-broker-plan-operators.yml

Ops instructions :
cf update-service-broker p-mysql cc <password> <broker url>
NB: the broker password can be retrieved from credhub /secrets/cloudfoundry_service_brokers_p-mysql_password

## feature-scaleup-gitlab-xlarge
scale gitlab vm_type xlarge (4 cpu 16G, was large 2 cpu 8G)

## feature-fix-kubo-human-readable-name
Fix: bosh-kubo must not set iaas human readable vm

## feature-Aremove-expedepls
remove all expe-depls, to move them to a dedicated long term feature branche
WARNING: this is a a destructive feature branche. Should be deployed with the companion branche feature-Aresurrect-expe-depls for runner still using some bosh deployments in expe-depls.

* [x]  Remove bosh-expe director
* [x]  Remove all deployments hold by bosh-expe director
* [x]  Remove useless network (terraform)
* [x]  Remove useless broker declaration (terraform)
* [x]  Export metabase data to metabase bosh-master

**WARNING:** this is a a destructive feature branche. Should be deployed with the companion branche feature-Aresurrect-expe-depls for runner still using some bosh deployments in expe-depls.
