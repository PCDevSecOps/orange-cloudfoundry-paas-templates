## feature-fix-prometheus-bosh-exporter
prometheus coab and kubo must scrape bosh with client-id/client-secrets

## feature-fix-cf-env-vars-69
see issue :
- set staging env vars [Issue 69](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/69)
- enable internet proxy access dns and asg for cf apps staging.
- fix credhub reference to /secrets/powerdns_api_key
- raise max async poll duration for OSB services (1 week, was 60min, too short for COAB and db-dumper)
- FIX: disable running scope for :
   - public_networks
   - fpv-internet
   - ldap
   - admin-ui
   - mail-fed
   - fpv-intranet
- define a new cf-ssh ASG, enabling cf ssh access for specific cf apps (like stratos portal for portal ssh access see [66](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/66))

### Manual platform ops steps
- this security group hardening might break some application using improper access. The markeplace intranet/internet services and /or isolation segment org do define the authorized outbound access.
- a cf app restart is required for sec groups change to be applied. If you want to force a general restart, bosh restart or recreate the diego-cell intance-groups (in master-depls/cf, and isolation segments deployments)
- the terraform cloudfoundry plugin 0.11.2 is required, check COA required COA 3.2.x version (https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/terraform-provider-cloudfoundry/releases/tag/v0.11.2)

## feature-fix-php-cached-buildpack-176
fix for [Issue 176](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/176).
Must specify multi stack for php buildpack.
see: https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/ci-buildpack-cached/pull/6

### Manual platform ops steps
- apply, let COA update pipeline master-depls-concourse-generated
- get old 4.3.63 in concourse resource (if it is not the latest loaded version)

```
log-fly
fly -t concourse-micro check-resource -r master-depls-cached-buildpack-pipeline/php-bp-release -f ref:v4.3.63
```

- pause every version more recent  than v4.3.63 on resource master-depls-cached-buildpack-pipeline/php-bp-release
- relaunch php buildpack build job master-depls-cached-buildpack-pipeline/deploy-php
- relaunch master-depls terraform, so the missing offline phpbuildpack is loaded in cloudfoundry

## feature-clean-boshexpe
This branch aims to clean latest bosh-expe references :
- credhub seeder (secrets-openstack-networks-operators.yml and secrets-openstack-networks-vars.yml)
- credhub seeder (secrets-bosh-operators.yml secrets-bosh-vars-tpl.yml)
- secrets model (tpl-secrets.yml) - bosh_expe_uuid and tf-net-expe in bootstrap branch
- expe powerdns record (private-dns.tf)
- expe cloudfoundry security groups (security-groups.tf)

## feature-fix-uaa-cve-2018-15761
bump uaa 64.0 for uaa privilege escalation CVE-2018-15761
see :
- https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2018-15761/
- https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-release/releases/tag/v64.0
- [Issue 175](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/175)

### Manual platform ops steps
- this bumps uaa to an advanced version wrt to cf-deployment 1.40 expected version (52.0)
- all bosh-xx deployments + credhub deployments will be updated
- a staged deployment is recommanded (micro-depls, then  master-depls, then ops-depls)

## feature-fix-openldap
This branch aims to fix openldap master-depls-bosh-generated/jobs/deploy-openldap deployment.

### Manual platform ops steps
Check that LDAP Database password is present in shared secrets file :

```
  ldap:
    root:
      password: root_redacted_password
    database:
      password: database_redacted_password
```

## feature-coa-upgrade-to-3-2-x
Bump of [cf-ops-automation](https://github.com/orange-opensource/cf-ops-automation) to latest [3.2.x](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/cf-ops-automation/releases/tag/v3.2.2) version is required.

### References
- [3.2.2 release note](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/cf-ops-automation/releases/tag/v3.2.2)
- [3.2.0 release note](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/cf-ops-automation/releases/tag/v3.2.0)

#### Limitations (know remaining issue)
- bootstrap-all-init-pipelines: this pipelines may have 2 failing jobs (`bootstrap-control-plane` and `bootstrap-update-pipelines`) while new pipelines are not enabled.
- please **do not** unpause the following pipelines, if exist:
    * control-plane
    * *-depls-bosh-generated
    * *-depls-update-generated

### Manual platform ops steps
To upgrade COA, adjust concourse credentials like below:

```yaml
cf-ops-automation-uri: https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/cf-ops-automation.git
cf-ops-automation-branch: master
cf-ops-automation-tag-filter: v3.2.2 # or higher
```

**Upgrade notes** ([3.2.x](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/cf-ops-automation/releases/tag/v3.2.0) release notes):
this version is based on `hotfix` branch instead of `master`, so some operations are required to have concourse detect
this version.

Recommended upgrade path:
1. update COA version and commit change to secrets repository
2. On `bootstrap-all-init-pipelines`, please manually trigger `bootstrap-pipelines`job to detect new COA version.  
You may also require to trigger `reload-this-pipeline-from-git`.

**Note**: it is not recommended to execute `upgrade\v3.2.0` scripts, it enable new pipelines. This activation is planned in another `paas-templates`version.

### Expected availability impacts
- concourse will trigger all jobs, but due to concurrency limitation introduced in 3.2.x (see [#184](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/cf-ops-automation/issues/184), only 5 jobs (by default) are executed in parallel
