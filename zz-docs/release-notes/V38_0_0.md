# V 38.0.0

## Release overview:
- cf-deployment 4.5
- add tcp-routing for internet isolation segment
- Flexible Engine natives services OSB support (including sqlserver)


## COA preinstallation (before release v 38.0.0)

Bump of [cf-ops-automation](https://github.com/orange-opensource/cf-ops-automation) to latest [3.3.x](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/cf-ops-automation/releases/tag/v3.3.0) version is required. 

### References
- [3.3.0 release note](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/cf-ops-automation/releases/tag/v3.3.0)

#### Limitations (know remaining issue)
- bootstrap-all-init-pipelines: this pipelines may have 1 failing jobs (`bootstrap-init-pipelines`).

### Manual platform ops steps

- From secrets root directory, update each bosh-director `ci-deployment-overview.yml` (**Note:** `save-ci-deployments-overview` directory contains initial configuration files)

```
$ DIRECTORS="cloudflare-depls coab-depls master-depls micro-depls ops-depls "
$ for director in ${DIRECTORS} ; do cp new-coa/ci-deployments-overview/${director}/ci-deployment-overview.yml ${director} ; done
```

- Rename `new-coa` directory to `coa`, commit and push updates to secrets repository

- Log to bootstrap instance, refresh local repositories and check if no concourse builds are present

```
$ cd /home/cloud/bosh/secrets
$ git pull
$ cd /home/cloud/git/cf-ops-automation
$ git pull
$ log-fly
$ fly builds
```

- If no builds, delete all pipelines and recreate them

```
$ pipelines=$(fly pipelines | grep -v "paused" | awk '{print $1}') ; for p in $pipelines ; do fly dp -p $p -n ; done
```

- Check if all pipelines are deleted

```
$ fly pipelines
```

- Recreate `bootstrap-all-init-pipelines` pipeline

```
$ export FLY_TARGET="fe-micro"
$ export SECRETS="/home/cloud/git/secrets"
$ ./concourse-bootstrap.sh
```

- Refresh (F5) concourse portal in your browser and wait all jobs in `bootstrap-all-init-pipelines` pipeline turn green

- Refresh (F5) and unpause `control-plane` and all `depls-update-generated` pipelines and wait all jobs turn green

- Refresh (F5) and unpause `sync-feature-branches` (wait `update-merged-wip-features` turns green)

- Pause following jobs:
  - `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-gitlab`, `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-powerdns-docker`
  - `master-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-openldap`

- Unpause every pipeline you want to activate

- Trigger `approve-and-enforce-terraform-consistency` on each bosh director

- Check each pipeline and retrigger jobs in error

### Expected availability impacts
- concourse will trigger all jobs, but due to concurrency limitation introduced in 3.2.x (see [#184](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/cf-ops-automation/issues/184), only 5 jobs (by default) are executed in parallel


## Installation modops
Before getting tag `38.0.0`:
- Pause all pipelines except `control-plane`, `sync-feature-branches` and `micro-depls-bosh-generated`
- Pause following jobs:
  - `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-gitlab`, `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-powerdns-docker`
  - `master-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-openldap`

- Update `shared/secrets.yml` with parameter defined in **Manual platform ops steps** section for the following features (trigger all deployments once):
  - [feature-cleanup-post-v30](##feature-cleanup-post-v30)
  - [feature-tcp-routing](##feature-tcp-routing)
  - [feature-huaweicloud-service-broker](##feature-huaweicloud-service-broker)

- Load tag "38.0.0" on "production" branch
- Delete old fix branches (e.g: feature-fix-post-v37.0.1)
- Commit and push `shared/secrets.yml` file
- Trigger `sync-feature-branches/reset-merged-wip-features`

- Checkout on "feature-fix-post-v38.0.0" branch for potentials workarounds
- Wait all `micro-depls-bosh-generated` jobs turns green
- Unpause all pipeline and wait jobs turns green

- Configure deployments with parameter defined in following **Manual platform ops steps** section

- When all deployments ended, make sequential operations (unpause job, wait it turns green and pause it again) on following jobs:
  - `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-gitlab`, `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-powerdns-docker`
  - `master-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-openldap`

## feature-dbdumper-fix
Fix db-dumper bugs

### References
- [Issue 130](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/130)

### Content (implementation)
- Fix wrong uaa client redirect url
- Rename db-dumper name under cloud foundry marketplace to avoid errors using db-dumper cli
- Remove db-dumper restrictions (will be available for all orgs)

#### Limitations (know remaining issue)
- [Issue 163](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/163)

### Manual platform ops steps
- Remove the db-dumper client id from the Cloud Foundry UAA

```
$ log-credhub
$ credhub g -n /bosh-master/cf/uaa_admin_client_secret | grep value:  # credential_leak_validated
value: <client-secret>

$ uaac target https://uaa.<redacted-system-domain> --ca-cert ${BOSH_CA_CERT}
$ uaac token client get admin -s <client-secret>
$ uaac client delete db-dumper
```

- Apply terraform on `ops-depls-bosh-generated` pipeline
- Update service broker

```
$ cf update-service-broker db-dumper <redacted-user> <redacted-password> <redacted-url>
```

- Check if new name is present in marketplace

```
$ cf marketplace
```

### Expected availability impacts
- Service will be down while merging this feature

## feature-postgres-restore-steps
Add document for postgresql db manual restore

## feature-cassandra-new-marketplace-plans2
Adapt marketplace plans for Cassandra dedicated (COAB)

## feature-tcp-routing
This feature provides the TCP routing Cloud Foundry Feature. The feature is only enabled for openstack-hws iaas type.

**NB:** TCP Routing is supported for shared domains only. However, the proposed implementation will be only for internet-is hosted cf apps.

### References
- [Issue 239](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/239)
- https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html
- https://docs.prod-cloud-ocb.orange-business.com/en-us/usermanual/antiddos/en-us_topic_0085804526.html

### Content (implementation)
- Disable existing tcp-router instance group on master-depls/cf
- Define a new openstack security group `tf-tcp-routing-sg`
- Define a bosh-master net-floating logical network, with tf-tcp-routing-sg
- Configure 2 tcp-router instance groups on `master-depls/isolation-segment-internet`
- Add a pair of haproxy, with floating ip endpoint, on net-floating network, and az1 az2. This will be a relay to the tcp routers (bosh links)

### End user new features
Users will be able to deploy apps not listening on the HTTP protocol but only TCP, on internet isolation segment organization

### Manual platform ops steps
- Allocate 2 floating ip on your tenant (one per az)
- Activate anti-DDOS on the 2 floating ips (eg: on flexible engine, limit the traffic to 10mbs, do not enable http protection as we want to accept raw tcp traffic)
- Add 2 DNS A records, with same public domain, to the floating ips
- Update `shared/secrets.yml` accordingly:

```
  cloudfoundry:
    ...
    #openstack-hws specific (tcp routing)
    default_router_group_reservable_port_min: "1024" #do not forget ", required by credhub seeder!
    default_router_group_reservable_port_max: "1123"
    cloudfoundry_tcp_routing_domain: <redacted domain> #--- eg tcp-int-domain.<redacted_public_domain>
    tcp_routing_public_ip_1: <redacted_floating_ip>   #--- z1 floating ip
    tcp_routing_public_ip_2: <redacted_floating_ip_2> #--- z2 floating ip
```

- Create a shared domain to support the routing group

```
$ cf create-shared-domain tcp-apps-domain.com --router-group default-tcp
```

- Set quota to zero on all non internet is cf organizations. This avoids users to provision unusable tcp routes.
For instance:

```
$ cf update-quota orange --reserved-route-ports 0
$ cf update-quota orange-internet --reserved-route-ports -1
```

- Test the tcp route feature on a cf app <app>

```
$ cf map-route <app> <redacted-tcp-domain> --random-port
```

## feature-cf-deployment-4.5
cf deployment 4.5:
- Use bosh-dns instead of consul for dns resolution and health check management (requires a bosh director v268)
- New instance group for cf embedded credhub
- log-cache activation
- tcp routing support on isolation-segment-internet
- Bump cf apps rootfs to 1.260
