## feature-neo4j-onboshops
The feature branch deploys neo4j service on bosh-ops :

- [x]  Instantiate bosh deployment

- [x]  Declare broker via terraform (keep existent declaration in bosh-expe)

- [x]  Documentation

- [x]  Test (sample-app)

Release note instructions for secrets repository :
* Create ops-depls/neo4j-docker and ops-depls/neo4j-docker/secrets directories
* Create secrets.yml file in ops-depls/neo4j-docker/secrets with the following content :

```
secrets:
  neo4j:
    broker:
      cookie_secret: redacted
      service_instance:
        username: redacted_username
        password: redacted_password
        environment: 'NEO4J_AUTH=redacted_username/redacted_password'

  dashboard:
    client_secret: redacted_secret
```

* Enable neo4j-docker on bosh-ops by putting a file called enable-deployment.yml in the directory ops-depls/neo4-docker

Manual terraform actions on concourse GUI :

Once neo4j-docker bosh deployment is green on Concourse, first trigger Concourse job "check-terraform-consistency" and "approve-and-enforce-terraform-consistency afterwards". This will register the neo4j broker in cloud foundry.

## feature-kafka-onboshops
The feature branch deploys kafka service on bosh-ops :
* https://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry-community/kafka-boshrelease?version=2.0.0

* [x]  Instantiate bosh deployment
* [x]  Declare broker via terraform
* [x]  Documentation
* [x]  Test (sample-app)

Pre-requisite MR :
* Refactoring credhub seeder => Merge-Request #255

Release note instructions for secrets repository :
* Create ops-depls/kafka directory
* Enable kafka on bosh-ops by putting a file called enable-deployment.yml in the directory ops-depls/kafka
* Generate a password with apg utility for the broker and put it in shared/secrets.yml file (the password will be seeded to credhub by the feature branch Merge-Request #255) 

Manual terraform actions on concourse GUI :

Once bosh deployment is green on Concourse, first trigger Concourse job "check-terraform-consistency" and "approve-and-enforce-terraform-consistency afterwards". This will register the kafka broker in cloud foundry.

```
  #--- Bosh directors
  bosh:
    admin:
      password: redacted_password
```

- Add service brokers passwords (if not exist) in ***/shared/secrets/secrets.yml*** file

```
secrets:
 cloudfoundry:
    service_brokers:
      o-intranet-proxy-access:
        password: redacted_password
      coa-mongodb-broker:
        password: redacted_password
      coa-rabbit-broker:
        password: redacted_password
```

      coa-rabbit-broker:
        password: redacted_password
```

## feature-clean-unused-ops-cf-rps
remove useless ops rp: ops traffic is direct from intranet_interco_relay to ops-routing gorouter (ssl enabled). Intermediate ssl is not required anymore

manual steps:
- move ops routing certs from master-depls/cf-rps/secrets/ops-certs... to shared/certs
- ensure master-depls/cf-rps and master-depls/ops-routing are updated accordingly

## feature-multi-az-mongo-cassandra
this features:
- leverages z1 and z2 azs for tf-net-services-2 network
- let ops-depls/mongodb and cassandra service use 2 azs

expected impact:

done:
* [X] update cf-isolation segment with cf-deployment 1.40.0. manifest
* [X] bump online buildpacks and terraform cached buildpacks
* [X] enable space self service for container networking https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-release/blob/master/jobs/policy-server/spec#L56
* [x] test container to container

limitations:
* [x] test diego container limit
* [ ] fix internet isolation segment smoke tests
* [ ] give operators network.admin scope (openldap group description)

Ops users:
- manual steps: trigger master-depls/terraform apply job to update the offline buildpacks
- this ugrade should apply smoothly, with no api or apps impact. The deployment time depends on the number of cells, and internet isolation segment cells.
- this upgrades the cflinuxfs2 to the latest version

End users:
- cf cli 6.38 is now recommanded: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.38.0
- container to container networking is now available
- buildpacks version are updated. a cf restage is recommanded to take benefit of latest versions

## feature-new-rabbit-mq
Migrate ops-depls/cf-rabbitmq to bosh 2 manifest syntax (including moving the deployment to a new network tf-net-services-2)
- [x] bump rabbitmq bosh release from 217 to 249 see https://github.com/pivotal-cf/cf-rabbitmq-release/releases/tag/v249.0.0
- [x] update ops-depls/cloudfoundry/terraform-config to target the new broker IP, and update broker cloudfoundry registration

RAF/ops manual step:

- check on preproduction environment that existing cloudfoundry instances are still ok (especially for "openstack" iaas type)

end-users impacts:
- rabbitmq broker is updated to OSS RabbitMQ 3.6.16 (EOL 05/2018) / OSS RabbitMQ 3.7.6

manual steps:
- create gitlab backup bucket:
```
paas-templates/master-depls/shield/scripts/init-shield.sh
```

Caution:
- the shield backup are not encrypted. The new gitlab backup could **leak all platform secrets** if the bucket is not properly secured !
- the docker bosh release  upgrade will induce a 5 min interruption on internet exposition
