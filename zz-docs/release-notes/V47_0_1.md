  ```yaml
  director_ssl:
      ca: |
        BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

#### Post-upgrade steps (after upgrade pipeline is done)

>**Note:**
>To do only if following deployments have not been triggered/recreateed by upgrade process

- Trigger `micro-depls/micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-bosh-master` concourse job and wait it turns green

- Trigger sequentially following concourse jobs in `master-depls/master-depls-bosh-generated` pipeline and wait they turn green:
  - `deploy-bosh-ops`
  - `deploy-bosh-coab`
  - `deploy-bosh-remote-r2`
  - `deploy-bosh-remote-r3`
  - `deploy-bosh-kubo`

- Recreate `micro-bosh` director from docker-bosh-cli

  ```bash
  $ cd ~/bosh/secrets
  $ git pull
  $ cd ~/bosh/template
  $ git pull
  $ admin/recreate-micro-bosh.sh
