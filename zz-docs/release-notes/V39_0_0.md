# V 39.0.0

## Release overview:
- cf-deployment 5.5
- general bump to xenial stemcell
- massive bosh releases bump
- security fixes (o-internet, runc cve)

## Installation overview
**End user impacts** : cf api down around 2 hours due to [feature-fix-ha-bosh-dns-config](##feature-fix-ha-bosh-dns-config)
  
Before getting tag `39.0.0`:
- ensure a `bootstrap VM` with a floating IP is up and running (with [feature-fix-ha-bosh-dns-config](##feature-fix-ha-bosh-dns-config), all networks connectivity is lost during a short time)  

- Pause all pipelines except `control-plane`, `sync-feature-branches` and `micro-depls-bosh-generated`
- Pause following jobs:
  - `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-gitlab`,
  - `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-credhub-ha`,
  - `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-concourse-micro`,
  - `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-powerdns-docker`
  - `master-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-openldap`

- Update `shared/secrets.yml` with parameter defined in **Manual platform ops steps** section for the following features:
  - [feature-externalize-marketplace](##feature-externalize-marketplace)
  - [feature-fix-terraform-coab](##feature-fix-terraform-coab)
  - [feature-remove-o-logs-service](##feature-remove-o-logs-service)
  - [feature-xenial-stemcell](##feature-xenial-stemcell)

- Load tag "39.0.0" on "production" branch
- Delete old fix branches
- Commit and push `shared/secrets.yml` file
- Trigger `sync-feature-branches/reset-merged-wip-features`

- Checkout on "feature-fix-post-v39.0.0" branch for potentials workarounds
- Wait all `micro-depls-bosh-generated` jobs turns green
- Unpause all pipelines one by one, and wait jobs turns green:
  - `master-depls-*-generated`,
  - `ops-depls-*-generated`,
  - `coab-depls-*-generated`,
  - `kubo-depls-*-generated` 

- Configure deployments with parameter defined in following **Manual platform ops steps** section

- When all deployments ended, make sequential operations (unpause job, wait it turns green and pause it again) on following jobs:
  - `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-gitlab`,
  - `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-credhub-ha`,
  - `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-powerdns-docker`,
  - `micro-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-concourse-micro`, (see [feature-tune-concourse](##feature-tune-concourse))
  - `master-depls-bosh-generated/deploy-openldap`

### Troubleshooting

#### master-depls/prometheus
You may encounter the following error, in docker logs on `thanos` or `pprometheus` VMs:
```
Error starting daemon: error initializing graphdriver: overlay2: the backing xfs filesystem is formatted without d_type support, which leads to incorrect behavior. Reformat the filesystem with ftype=1 to enable d_type support. Backing filesystems without d_type support are not supported.
```

The workaround is to delete the deployment manually and recreates it using concourse. To delete the deployment:
  `bosh -e master -d prometheus delete-deployment` 


## COAB recurrent tasks (https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/304 - will be automated soon):
- update service brokers (by using CF-CLI)
```
cf update-service-broker p-coab-cassandra user<redacted_password> https://coa-cassandra-broker.<CF_API_DOMAIN>
cf update-service-broker p-coab-cf-mysql user<redacted_password> https://coa-cf-mysql-broker.<CF_API_DOMAIN>
cf update-service-broker p-coab-mongodb user<redacted_password> https://coa-mongodb-broker.<CF_API_DOMAIN>
```

- rebase COAB service instances branches (from local paas-templates by using GIT-CLI) :

```
    # COAB cassandra
    git checkout feature-coabdepls-cassandra-serviceinstances
    git pull
    git rebase origin/master
    git push -f
    
    # COAB mongodb
    git checkout feature-coabdepls-mongodb-serviceinstances
    git pull
    git rebase origin/master
    git push -f
    
    
    # COAB cf-mysql
    git checkout feature-coabdepls-cf-mysql-serviceinstances
    git pull
    git rebase origin/master
    git push -f
```

## feature-fix-terraform-coab

this branch aims to fix terrafom coab (check-terraform-consistency job) : 
3 error(s) detected:
	
 - $.cloudfoundry.coa_gogs_password: Unable to resolve `secrets.cloudfoundry.service_brokers.coa-gogs-broker.password`: `$.secrets.cloudfoundry.service_brokers.coa-gogs-broker` could not be found in the datastructure

### Manual platform ops steps
- update global secrets file if not exists as below (you can generate the passwords with apg command) :

```
    service_brokers:
      coa-noop-broker:
        password: <>
      coa-gogs-broker:
        password: <>
      coa-prometheus-broker:

## feature-remove-o-logs-service

remove legacy o-logs service.

### References
- https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/275

### Content (implementation)
- remove cf app broker, and terraform broker declaration

### End user new features
- unused service wont be in the marketplace anymore
- existing o-logs services will be purged. No impact on log centralization


### Manual platform ops steps
- check log-sec broker app deployment organization and space:
```
cat ops-depls/cf-apps-deployments/log-sec-broker/enable-cf-app.yml
```

it should be deployed in `system_domain` org and `log-brokers` space   

- remove secrets for log-sec broker app:

```
rm -r ops-depls/cf-apps-deployments/log-sec-broker
```

- remove broker password from secrets repo shared/secrets.yml:

```
secrets:
...
      o-log:          #  ---> REMOVE
        password: redacted_password #  ---> REMOVE
```
NB: this will trigger a global COA redeploy. Can differ this step after the version upgrade.

- purge o-logs service instances:

```
cf purge-service-offering o-logs
```

- apply ops-depls/terraform, this should delete the o-logs service broker

- also you can delete the spring-cloud-config secrets repo:

```
rm -r apps-dev/log-cf-broker
```

- destroy  log-sec broker space:

```bash
cf delete-space <log-brokers-space> -o <log-borkers-org-system_domain>
```


## feature-fix-ha-bosh-dns-config

- Improve bosh dns config to use az aware dns name.

- Set proxy protocol for apps traffic to propagate origin ip in x-forwarded-for http header.
- Set proxy protocol for api traffic to propagate origin ip in x-forwarded-for http header.
- switch compilation network to static ip. Requires to have distinct cloud-config definitions per director
  - dhcp reserved: 2 - 20
  - micro: 21 - 40
  - master: 41 - 60
  - ops: 61-80
  - coab:  81-100
  - kubo: 101 - 120

### References
- https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/237
- https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/paas-templates/issues/112
- https://www.haproxy.com/fr/blog/the-four-essential-sections-of-an-haproxy-configuration/

### Content (implementation)
- split ops-router bosh alias as 2 aliases ops-router-z1/ops-router-z2 to let haproxy manage HA redirects.
- remove unused 3128 relay to intranet proxy (now squid 3129 is used)
- the api relay haproxy is translated in master-depls/cf
- update cloud-config for compilation definition

### Manual platform ops steps
**Warning**: while master-depls/intranet-interco-relay is updated, connectivity is lost and may required access from bootstrap VM (with EIP)
- first deploy master-depls/cf. should fail due to cf api ip already used
- the deploy master-depls/intranet-interco-relay, this deletes the api-relay, and frees the cpi api ip
  - it is required to manually downscale master-depls/intranet-interco-relay to allow ops-router-z2 creation:
  
```bash
#log to bosh-master
# download manifest
bosh -e master-depls -d intranet-interco-relay manifest > intranet-interco-relay.yml
# manually edit downloaded manifest
  # reduce instance to 1
  # delete the line defininf the static ip: 192.168.99.82
bosh -e master-depls -d intranet-interco-relay deploy intranet-interco-relay.yml
```

bosh should apply something like this:

```
  instance_groups:
  - name: ops-routing-router
-   instances: 2
+   instances: 1
    networks:
    - name: tf-net-exchange
      static_ips:
-     - 192.168.99.82

Continue? [yN]: y
```

  - manually trigger master-depls/intranet-interco-relay job 
  - relaunch master-depls/cf, should deploy successfully the target api-relay for cf api traffic

### Expected availability impacts
- cf api: down ~ 2 hours, time for multiple deployments to translate api from intranet-interco-relay to master-depls/cf


## feature-cf-deployment-5.5

update master-depls/cf.

```

- launch concourse deploy-script on each root deployment (uploads syslog release)
You can use concourse GUI, or the following scriptlet as inspiration:

```bash
export BOSH_ENV_LIST="micro master ops kubo coab"
echo "You have to logging into MAIN team"
fly -t manual login -c https://elpaaso-concourse-micro..... -k -u atc -p ${FLY_PASSWORD}
